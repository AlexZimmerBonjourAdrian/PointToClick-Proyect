High Concept: 100 Monsters Must Die - Negotiation & Betrayal
Logline: Outsmart 100 unique monsters, not with brute force, but with cunning. Persuade, manipulate, or betray your way to victory in this strategic turn-based game where every monster reacts uniquely to your approach.

Pitch: Forget mindless button-mashing. In 100 Monsters Must Die, your survival depends on your wit and cunning. Each monster is a puzzle, reacting uniquely to your dialogue choices. Will you charm a fearsome beast into submission? Bribe a greedy goblin into revealing a weakness? Or orchestrate a treacherous alliance to turn one monster against another? With branching dialogue trees, unpredictable monster reactions, and a constantly escalating challenge, every playthrough is a unique and thrilling adventure.

Core Gameplay: Players face 100 progressively more challenging monsters. Instead of direct combat, players engage in turn-based interactions using dialogue options focused on persuasion, manipulation, and betrayal. Success hinges on understanding each monster's personality, motivations, and weaknesses. Clever choices unlock new dialogue options, reveal hidden paths, and lead to unique outcomes. Failure might result in a direct confrontation or a disadvantageous situation. The game rewards players who experiment, adapt, and learn from their mistakes.
