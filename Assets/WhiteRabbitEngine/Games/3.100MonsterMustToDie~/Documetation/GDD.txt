Game Art Style

The game features a geometric art style.

Player: Represented by rectangular shapes, arrows, and potentially transforming between a robot and a plane.
Enemies: Abstract and 3D geometric shapes (triangles, spheres, boxes, pyramids, cones, and a unique "Head" boss).
Projectiles: Distorted capsules and ovoid shapes.
Gameplay

The player can switch between three forms:

Plane: Focuses on speed, missile attacks, evading enemy fire, and curved machine gun fire. Excels at movement and evasion.
Robot: Emphasizes precision and close-range combat. Can rotate, shoot in all directions, and teleport short distances (dash). Slower movement speed.
Hybrid Robot-Plane: Balances firepower and maneuverability. Can rotate and move laterally while maintaining aim. Shoots missiles, bullets, and extra projectiles. More challenging to control.
Enemies

Triangle: Basic enemy. Follows the player, flies nearby, and occasionally shoots. Low health, low fire rate, easy to kill, fast speed.
Abstract Forms: Larger enemies that attempt melee attacks. More health and slightly higher damage than Triangles. Slow speed.
Static Form: Stationary enemy. Rapidly fires bullets in five directions. Medium health.
Cone: Rhino-like enemy. Charges at the player. Medium health, very fast charge speed, melee attack, slow normal movement.
Sphere: Shoots a single, instant-kill beam. Low health, slow movement, beam lasts 3 seconds with a 5-second cooldown.
Pyramid: Creates a spiral bullet tornado. High health, slow movement, fires when the player is near with a 2-second cooldown.
Box: Follows the player and explodes on contact. Very low health, explosion damage, fast movement.
Head (Boss): Shoots rays and bullets from its mouth and eyes. High health. Three attack patterns: mouth ray, eye bullets, and rhino-like charge when low on health. Defeating the Head wins the game.
