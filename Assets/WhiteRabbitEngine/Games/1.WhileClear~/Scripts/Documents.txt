Okay, I understand. Based on the Game Design Document (GDD) provided for "WhileClear: Simplified" (aka "99 Rooms: Simplified"), here's a list of potential classes you'd need to create this game, categorized by their general purpose within the game's architecture. I'll try to be as comprehensive as possible, keeping in mind the game's focus on simplicity and puzzle-solving:

I. Core Game Logic & Structure

GameManager:
Responsibilities: Orchestrates the entire game flow. Handles the current room, transitions between rooms, puzzle completion status, the timer, and potentially loading/saving game data.
Functionality:
StartGame(): Initializes the game.
LoadRoom(roomID): Loads a specific room scene.
CompleteRoom(roomID): Marks a room as completed.
AdvanceToNextRoom(): Advances the player to the next room.
UpdateTimer(): Manages the game timer.
ProvideHint(): (If using a hint system) Gives a hint to the player.
SaveGame(): Saves the current game state.
LoadGame(): Loads a previously saved game state.
Restart(): Restart the entire game.
Room:
Responsibilities: Represents a single room in the game. Manages the puzzles and objects within the room.
Functionality:
Initialize(): Sets up the room's objects and puzzles.
CheckPuzzleCompletion(): Checks if the puzzle(s) in the room are solved.
OnPlayerEntered(): Triggers events when the player enters the room.
OnPlayerExited(): Triggers events when the player exits the room.
GetAllObjects(): returns all interactable objects of the room.
IsCompleted(): Returns true if the room is solved.
Puzzle:
Responsibilities: Abstract base class for different puzzle types. Defines the core functionality of a puzzle.
Functionality:
CheckSolution(): Checks if the player's actions have solved the puzzle.
GetHint(): Returns a hint string or data.
Reset(): Resets the puzzle to its initial state.
IsSolved(): Returns true if the puzzle is solved.
Derived Puzzle Classes:
InventoryPuzzle: A puzzle that requires the use of inventory items.
SequencePuzzle: A puzzle that requires putting things in the correct order.
LogicPuzzle: A pure logic based puzzle.
CombinationPuzzle: For puzzles that require combining different items to solve them.
PatternPuzzle: For puzzles that require matching or repeating a pattern.
NumberPuzzle: for puzzles based on numbers or math problems.
And other puzzles based on the GDD.
II. Player Interaction & Input

PlayerController:
Responsibilities: Manages player input (mouse clicks or touch) and interaction with objects.
Functionality:
OnMouseClick(position): Handles mouse clicks.
OnTouch(position): Handles touch input.
InteractWithObject(object): Triggers interaction with a clicked object.
PickUpObject(object): Adds an object to the inventory.
InteractableObject:
Responsibilities: Abstract base class for any object the player can interact with.
Functionality:
OnInteract(): What happens when the player interacts with the object.
GetDescription(): Returns the object's description.
IsPickupable(): Returns true if the player can put the object in the inventory.
IsUsable(): Return true if the player can use this object.
Derived Interactable Object Classes:
Item: objects that the player can pick up and put in the inventory.
Button: interactable objects that may trigger something.
Lever: interactable objects that may trigger something.
Door: objects that represent the door of the room.
III. Inventory & Resources

Inventory:
Responsibilities: Stores and manages the items the player has collected.
Functionality:
AddItem(item): Adds an item to the inventory.
RemoveItem(item): Removes an item from the inventory.
HasItem(item): Checks if the inventory contains a specific item.
GetInventoryItems(): returns all items the player has.
UseItem(item): Uses an item on another object.
Item:
Responsibilities: Represents an individual item in the game.
Functionality:
GetName(): Returns the item's name.
GetDescription(): Returns the item's description.
Use(): Triggers an event when the item is used.
IV. User Interface (UI)

UIManager:
Responsibilities: Manages all UI elements. Displays information, handles button clicks, etc.
Functionality:
ShowInventory(): Displays the inventory UI.
ShowHintUI(hintText): Displays a hint.
ShowRoomCompletedUI(): Displays when a room is completed.
ShowGameCompletedUI(): Displays when all rooms are completed.
UpdateTimeDisplay(time): Update the UI timer.
ShowMainMenu(): Show the main menu UI.
InventoryUI:
Responsibilities: Specific UI element for the inventory.
Functionality:
DisplayItems(items): Displays the list of items in the inventory.
OnItemClicked(item): Handles clicking on an inventory item.
HintUI:
Responsibilities: Specific UI element for the hints.
Functionality:
ShowHint(text): Shows the hint in the UI.
TimerUI
Responsibilities: Specific UI element for the timer.
Functionality:
UpdateTime(): Updates the displayed time.
MainMenuUI:
Responsibilities: Specific UI for the main menu.
Functionality:
OnPlayButtonClicked(): Called when the player hits the play button.
OnRestartButtonClicked(): Called when the player hits the restart button.
V. Other

SaveData:
Responsibilities: A data class (struct or class) that holds all the information needed to save the game state (e.g., current room, rooms completed, inventory).
AudioManager:
Responsibilities: Manages all audio in the game (music and sound effects).
Functionality:
PlayMusic(musicClip): Plays background music.
PlaySoundEffect(soundClip): Plays a sound effect.
RoomData:
Responsibilities: A data class that holds the data of each room. (e.g. Puzzle, Objects, etc)
PuzzleData:
Responsibilities: A data class that holds the data of each puzzle. (e.g. solution, type, etc)
ItemData:
Responsibilities: A data class that holds the data of each item. (e.g. name, description, etc)
Important Considerations:

Inheritance: Utilize inheritance effectively to create a hierarchy of puzzle types and interactable objects.
Interfaces: Consider using interfaces to define common functionalities (e.g., IInteractable, IPuzzle) to promote code flexibility.
Data-Driven Design: Use data structures (like dictionaries or lists) or even external data files (like JSON or XML) to define rooms, puzzles, and items. This makes it easy to add new content without modifying core code.
Unity: This project can be done with unity, and a lot of this classes could be MonoBehaviours.
This is a comprehensive starting point. As you start implementing, you may discover the need for additional classes or refinements to the existing ones. Remember that the key to this game is simple and accessible puzzle design, so keep the system lean and focused on that goal.
