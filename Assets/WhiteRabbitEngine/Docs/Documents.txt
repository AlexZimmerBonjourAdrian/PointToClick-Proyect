Unlock Limitless Creativity with the WhiteRabbit Engine's Adaptive Framework.

The WhiteRabbit Engine revolutionizes point-and-click game development with its unique, hierarchical structure (Core -> Inheritance -> Specialization -> Experimental). This innovative design ensures a rock-solid foundation while providing a clear path for customization and experimentation. Build upon inheritable generic classes to accelerate your workflow, and leverage Assembly Dependencies to create a truly modular project. With WhiteRabbit, you're not locked into a rigid system. You have the power to customize and personalize every aspect of the engine. GameEvent allows you to listen to events and execute functions. The prototype included will show you how to use the engine.

Key USPs:

Hierarchical Structure: Organized, stable, and flexible.
Inheritable Classes: Accelerated development.
Modular Design: Assembly Dependencies for project control.
Customizable and Personalized: Tailor the engine to your vision.
GameEvent: Listen to events and execute functions.
Prototype: See the engine in action.
