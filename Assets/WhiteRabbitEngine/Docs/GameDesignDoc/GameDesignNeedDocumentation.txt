    Okay, I understand. You're asking about the types of documentation a game designer uses and the estimated pre-production timelines based on the estimated size/duration of game development. You want to ignore the previous content if it's not relevant to this request. Let's focus on that.

Types of Documentation Used by a Game Designer

Game designers create a variety of documents throughout the development process. These can be broadly categorized as:

1. High-Level Design Documents (Initial Concepting):

Game Concept Document (GCD) / High Concept Document: (We have already seen this one)
Purpose: Captures the core idea of the game, target audience, genre, unique selling points, and a brief overview of the gameplay loop. It's used to quickly evaluate the viability of the idea.
Audience: Producers, publishers, core team, investors.
Focus: Big picture, "why this game should exist."
Pitch Deck:
Purpose: A visual presentation (often a PowerPoint or similar) that summarizes the GCD and presents it in a more engaging way, often including concept art, mockups, and market analysis.
Audience: Publishers, investors, stakeholders.
Focus: Selling the game idea.
Mood Board:
Purpose: A collection of visual references (images, videos, sounds) that represent the intended atmosphere, style, and tone of the game.
Audience: Art team, core team.
Focus: Establishing the aesthetic vision.
Competitive Analysis:
Purpose: A breakdown of the game's competition, with what makes them work, and what doest work, for understand the best way to engage the audience.
Audience: Core Team, producers.
Focus: Understand the market.
2. Core Design Documents (Detailed Design):

Game Design Document (GDD) - Comprehensive:
Purpose: The "bible" of the game. A living document that contains a detailed description of every aspect of the game: core mechanics, gameplay systems, level design, UI/UX, narrative, characters, world, etc.
Audience: Entire development team (programmers, artists, level designers, writers, etc.).
Focus: "How the game works."
Systems Design Documents:
Purpose: Detailed breakdowns of specific game systems (combat, inventory, crafting, economy, progression, etc.).
Audience: Programmers, system designers, QA.
Focus: The nuts and bolts of how each system functions.
Level Design Documents:
Purpose: Detailed layouts, flow, and scripting for individual levels or areas.
Audience: Level designers, artists, programmers.
Focus: "How the player experiences the game's space."
UI/UX Flowcharts and Wireframes:
Purpose: Diagrams and mockups of the user interface and how the player navigates menus and interacts with the game.
Audience: UI artists, programmers, UX designers.
Focus: "How the player interacts with the game's systems."
Technical Design Document
Purpose: A technical specification of the systems, with a programing focus.
Audience: Programmers
Focus: How implement the game in the engine.
3. Supporting Design Documents (Day-to-Day):

Feature Specifications:
Purpose: Detailed descriptions of individual features, breaking them down into their components and how they should work.
Audience: Programmers, artists, designers, QA.
Focus: "What each feature should do."
Task Breakdown (Agile/Scrum):
Purpose: Breaking down larger features into smaller, manageable tasks for development sprints.
Audience: Entire development team.
Focus: Tracking development progress.
Change Logs:
Purpose: Documenting changes to the GDD or specific features to track revisions and updates.
Audience: Entire development team.
Focus: Keeping track of the game's evolution.
Scripting Documents:
Purpose: Specific scripting events, and character dialogues
Audience: Scripters, programers, narrative writers.
Focus: Add life to the game.
Narrative Documents
Purpose Scripting events and histories of the game.
Audience: Narrative Writers, Level designers
Focus: Make a solid Universe.
Bug Reports
Purpose: A list of bugs in the game.
Audience: Programmers, QA
Focus: Repair the game.
Estimated Pre-Production Timelines

Pre-production is the crucial phase where the game is planned, and the core design is solidified. The length of pre-production varies greatly depending on the scope of the project. Here's a rough estimate:

4 Months (Small Indie Game):
Pre-Production: 1-2 months.
Documentation Focus: High Concept, Pitch Deck, Basic GDD (core mechanics, loop), mood board, maybe a few basic system design docs.
Key Activities: Prototyping core mechanics, solidifying the vision, initial art tests.
9 Months (Medium Indie/AA Game):
Pre-Production: 2-4 months.
Documentation Focus: More detailed GDD, system design documents, basic level design, UI/UX flowcharts.
Key Activities: Deeper prototyping, vertical slice development, art style finalization, initial level blockouts.
1.5 Years (AAA-Lite or Ambitious AA):
Pre-Production: 4-8 months.
Documentation Focus: Comprehensive GDD, detailed system design documents, level design documents, narrative outlining, UI/UX wireframes, feature specifications.
Key Activities: Extensive prototyping, vertical slice refinement, narrative bible, level design blockouts, tech testing.
3 Years (AAA Title):
Pre-Production: 6-12+ months.
Documentation Focus: Extensive and detailed GDD, system design documents, level design documents, narrative design documents, UI/UX documentation, feature specs, technical design documents, multiple prototypes, art bibles.
Key Activities: Extensive prototyping of multiple systems, concept testing, vertical slices, art and tech pipeline creation, pre-production and production pipelines.
5 Years (Large AAA or Innovative Title):
Pre-Production: 12-24+ months.
Documentation Focus: Everything from the 3-year project, but even more thorough. Expect multiple GDD versions, extensive feature testing, specialized design documents for unique systems, extensive documentation for each team.
Key Activities: Multiple vertical slices, iterative prototyping, massive playtesting, research and development of new technologies, multiple art and tech pipelines.
Important Considerations:

Iterative Development: These are estimates. Game development is iterative. Pre-production may bleed into production and vice versa.
Team Size: Larger teams need more documentation.
Complexity: More complex games need more thorough planning.
Agile vs. Waterfall: Agile development has a more fluid approach to documentation, while waterfall is more rigid.
Prototyping: Pre-production is all about prototyping. A good prototype is worth a thousand pages of documentation.

================================================================================================================================================================

Okay, I understand. You're asking for advice on documentation and design focus for indie developers of different sizes (solo, 2-3 devs, and a small team of ~23), with examples from the market. You want me to consider the previous document's content but only if it is relevant. The previous doc is extremly relevant so I will take it in to acount.

Here's a breakdown of recommendations for each indie development scenario, focusing on what's essential and what can be deprioritized, along with market examples:

Guiding Principle: Keep It Lean and Focused. Indie development is about efficiency. Time and resources are limited. Don't over-document or over-design. Prioritize the core gameplay experience.

Scenario 1: Solo Developer

Focus: Core Loop, Vertical Slice, Playability.
What to Prioritize:
High Concept Document (GCD): Absolutely essential. Define the core idea, genre, and target audience. Keep it concise. It should answer, what is the game? and why is it fun?.
Core Mechanic Prototype: Spend the majority of your time building a playable prototype of the core mechanic. This is far more valuable than a huge GDD.
Basic Game Design Document (GDD): A lightweight GDD, mainly to document the core gameplay loop, player progression, and key features. Update it as you develop. Think of it as a living checklist.
Mood Board: Gather visual and audio references to define the game's feel.
Task Breakdown: Use a simple task management system (Trello, Notion, even a spreadsheet) to track your progress.
Change Log: Have a basic system for tracking what you change.
Bug report: Is the most important part, you must have a list of bugs.
What to Deprioritize:
Extensive GDD Details: Don't get bogged down in writing pages of elaborate details for every feature. Focus on what's necessary to build the prototype.
Comprehensive System Design Docs: You likely don't need separate documents for each system. Integrate system designs directly into your main GDD or in a well organized list.
Detailed UI/UX Flowcharts: Unless you're creating a menu-heavy game, focus on a simple, functional UI that you can iterate on.
Narrative Bible (at first): If the story is simple, don't create an entire "lore bible" until you have a working game.
Technical Design Document: You can skip this part at first, try to make the game playable, then you can go back to this part.
Market Examples (Solo Successes):
Stardew Valley (ConcernedApe): Emphasis on a strong core loop (farming, relationships), iterative development, and responding to player feedback.
Papers, Please (Lucas Pope): Unique concept, tight core mechanic (document inspection), strong mood and atmosphere.
Undertale (Toby Fox): Focused on narrative, unique gameplay twists, and a strong emotional connection with the player.
Baba is you: A simple game, with a strong core loop and a unique visual.
Why It Works:
Rapid Iteration: Solo devs need to experiment quickly.
Core Loop Focus: A fun core mechanic will carry the game.
Personal Vision: The game is driven by a single vision.
Scenario 2: Small Team (2-3 Developers)

Focus: Communication, Clear Roles, Modular Design.
What to Prioritize:
High Concept Document (GCD): Essential to align the team.
More Detailed GDD: A more robust GDD to ensure everyone is on the same page. Break it down into sections if necessary.
Core System Design Documents: For example, a separate combat or crafting system doc if these are important features.
UI/UX Flowcharts: More important now for consistent UI/UX design.
Basic Level Design Docs: If you're making levels, basic layouts and flow plans are helpful.
Feature Specifications: Start breaking down features into more precise specifications, especially when tasks are handed off.
Shared Task Tracking: Use a shared system (Trello, Jira, etc.).
Change Logs: is important, for a fluid desing.
Bug Reports: a shared list will make it easyer to resolve bugs.
Basic Narrative document at least one, to keep the team on track.
What to Deprioritize:
Overly Detailed Narrative Bible: Still keep it to core story elements.
Extremely Granular Feature Specs: Keep them at a reasonable level of detail.
Extremely strict Technical Design Document: Is not needed to make the game, but can be useful.
Multiple iterations of High-Level documents: Try to stick to one version if you can.
Market Examples (Small Team Successes):
Celeste (Matt Makes Games, now Extremely OK Games): Tight platforming controls, strong level design, and a powerful narrative.
Overcooked (Ghost Town Games): Strong core concept, excellent co-op design, focused on simple systems that create complex gameplay.
Among Us (InnerSloth): Simple core loop, focused on social interaction, strong visuals.
Hades (Supergiant Games): A small team with a big idea.
Why It Works:
Clearer Communication: Documents are now necessary to share knowledge.
Specialization: Developers can focus on specific systems.
Modularity: The game can be built in more distinct modules.
Scenario 3: Small Team (~23 Developers)

Focus: Organization, Pipeline, Specialization, Communication.
What to Prioritize:
Comprehensive GDD: A more thorough GDD, broken into sections.
System Design Documents: Separate docs for each core system.
Level Design Documents: Detailed layouts, blockouts, scripting plans.
UI/UX Documentation: Detailed flowcharts, wireframes, and style guides.
Feature Specifications: Precise specifications are vital.
Technical Design Documents: To specify how the game will be build in the engine.
Narrative Documents: A comprehensive narrative design and lore bible.
Version Control: (Git, Perforce) is mandatory.
Change Log: Must be update when make a change.
Bug Reports: A well organized bug report, with categories.
Pipeline Documentation: How assets are created, implemented, and managed.
What to Deprioritize:
Overly Abstract Concepts: Everything should be grounded in the reality of what you can build.
Overly complex High-Level documents: Stick to one High-Level document if possible.
Unnecessary Redundancy: Streamline the documentation process.
Market Examples (Small Team but Ambitious):
Dead Cells (Motion Twin): Excellent combat system, procedural generation, iterative development.
Slay the Spire (Mega Crit Games): Complex card game mechanics, well-designed progression.
Risk of Rain 2 (Hopoo Games): Strong rogue-lite elements, tight core gameplay loop.
Valheim: A small team that made a huge success.
Why It Works:
Organization: Documentation helps coordinate the larger team.
Specialization: Team members have well-defined roles.
Pipeline: A workflow is established to move assets through the production process.
General Tips for All Indie Teams:

Start Simple: Build a working prototype of the core gameplay loop first.
Iterate: Don't get attached to early ideas. Be willing to change.
Playtest Early and Often: Get feedback from players as soon as possible.
Keep it Fun: The core gameplay loop needs to be enjoyable.
Use Tools: Utilize project management, version control, and communication tools.
Be flexible: Don't be afraid to change your plans.
By focusing on the core elements and scaling your documentation appropriately, indie developers of any size can increase their chances of success. I hope this detailed answer is helpful! Let me know if you have more questions.
