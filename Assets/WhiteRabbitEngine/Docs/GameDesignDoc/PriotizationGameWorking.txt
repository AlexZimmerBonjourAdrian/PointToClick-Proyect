Let's analyze the feasibility of each high concept for creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and their level of ambition. We'll consider development time, market impact (if fully realized), and ambition level (0-10).

Feasibility & Market Impact (MVP & Full Game):

100 Monsters Must Die:

MVP Feasibility: High. A core loop of dialogue-driven puzzle solving with a few unique monsters could be built relatively quickly. Focus on a small, cohesive set of monsters and dialogue trees first.
Full Game Market Impact: Medium to High. The unique dialogue-driven system could attract a niche audience, but wider appeal depends on execution and marketing.
Ambition Level: 7/10 (100 monsters is a significant undertaking).
Kindom (The Yellow King's Menagerie):

MVP Feasibility: Medium. A core loop of managing a few unique creatures with distinct needs and a simplified narrative could work for an MVP. Focus on a smaller menagerie and less complex resource management.
Full Game Market Impact: Medium. Similar to 100 Monsters, success depends on execution and marketing, attracting fans of management/simulation games with dark themes.
Ambition Level: 6/10 (The full scope of unique creatures, ethical choices, and narrative is quite ambitious).
Guardianes Nocturnos (FNAF-inspired):

MVP Feasibility: Medium to High. A single location with a few animatronics, limited resources, and a short, focused narrative could be a viable MVP.
Full Game Market Impact: High. Leveraging the FNAF fanbase is a significant advantage, but needs a fresh take to stand out. High risk/high reward.
Ambition Level: 8/10 (Multiple endings and a deep narrative add to the ambition).
Can It Ate Meat (revised "Pet Project"):

MVP Feasibility: High. A core loop of puzzle-solving, resource gathering, and creature evolution with a small number of puzzles and a simple evolution system is achievable for an MVP.
Full Game Market Impact: Medium. The unique premise is intriguing, but needs strong execution and marketing to break through.
Ambition Level: 5/10 (The original concept was extremely ambitious, but the revised version is more manageable).
Strange Goods (The Oddity Emporium):

MVP Feasibility: High. A core loop of serving customers, earning money, and upgrading a store with a few unique customers and a smaller set of items is easily achievable as an MVP.
Full Game Market Impact: Medium. The casual time management genre is competitive but the unique twist could attract attention.
Ambition Level: 6/10 (The increasing grotesqueness of customers and the twist add to the ambition).
While Clear (99 Rooms: Simplified):

MVP Feasibility: Very High. A small number of rooms with simple puzzles can be a great MVP. Very quick to prototype and iterate.
Full Game Market Impact: Low to Medium. The escape room market is saturated, but a well-polished, simple game could find an audience.
Ambition Level: 3/10 (99 rooms is ambitious, but the simplified design makes it more manageable).
Summary:

For the fastest MVP with potential for relatively quick market testing, While Clear and Can It Ate Meat stand out due to their simpler core mechanics. Strange Goods also offers a solid MVP with faster development time.

For higher market impact potential in the long run (but higher development risk and time), Guardianes Nocturnos and 100 Monsters Must Die are intriguing choices, leveraging existing fanbases or unique gameplay mechanics.

It's important to note that market impact depends heavily on execution, marketing, and the overall quality of the final product. A well-executed less ambitious game can be more successful than a poorly executed ambitious one.

Based on the provided analyses, if I had to choose one game to create an MVP, I would select While Clear (99 Rooms: Simplified).

The reasons are:

Highest MVP Feasibility: It has the highest feasibility score, indicating it can be prototyped and iterated upon quickly. A small number of rooms with simple puzzles is a minimal, testable core loop.

Faster Iteration: The simplified nature allows for rapid prototyping and testing. Feedback can be incorporated quickly and efficiently.

Lower Risk: The lower ambition level reduces the risk of scope creep and delays. A successful MVP can be expanded upon later.

While other games like Can It Ate Meat and Strange Goods also have high feasibility, While Clear has a simpler core mechanic, making it the quickest to get to a functional MVP state. This allows for faster market testing and validation of the core concept. The other games have more complex mechanics that would take longer to implement and test in a basic MVP
