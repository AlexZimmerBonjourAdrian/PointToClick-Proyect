Based on the provided GDD for "WhileClear: Simplified," here's a development plan, highlighting any unclear factors:

Phase 1: Core Mechanics & Prototype (2-3 Weeks)

Engine Selection: Finalize the game engine (Godot is still recommended for speed of development). This should have been decided before the GDD was written, so this is a clarification needed before proceeding.

Core Mechanic Implementation (Room 1): Build ONE single room with a basic puzzle mechanic (e.g., simple inventory puzzle, matching pattern puzzle, or simple code-breaking). The GDD mentions different puzzle types, but doesn't specify which one to start with for the MVP. Choose one core mechanic to focus on for the MVP.

Basic UI Implementation: Create the minimal UI elements needed for interaction (clicking on objects, displaying inventory, hints if included).

Testing (Room 1): Thoroughly test the single room with at least 5 playtesters, focusing on puzzle clarity, intuitiveness, and the overall experience. Iterate based on the feedback. This is critical â€“ don't skip this step.

Phase 2: Expand and Refine (3-4 Weeks)

Add 2-3 Rooms: Create additional rooms with puzzles using the same core mechanic as the first room, but increase complexity gradually. Stick to the chosen core mechanic from Phase 1 to keep the scope manageable for the MVP.

Refine UI/UX: Improve the UI based on feedback from Phase 1. Make sure the interactions are clear and intuitive.

Sound Design (Basic): Add basic sound effects for interactions (clicks, successful puzzle completion).

Testing (Multiple Rooms): Repeat testing with a larger group of players.

Phase 3: MVP Release (1-2 Weeks)

Bug Fixing and Polish: Address bugs and refine the game's polish.

Platform Selection: Choose Itch.io for initial release for ease of use and feedback collection.

Marketing: Create a simple landing page and social media campaign to announce the game's release.

Unclear Factors in the GDD:

Puzzle Mechanics: The GDD mentions various puzzle types, but doesn't definitively state which should be prioritized for the MVP. This needs to be decided before starting development. The focus should be on a single, well-refined mechanic for the MVP.

Hint System: The GDD mentions an optional hint system, but doesn't detail how it would work (frequency, cost, etc.). This needs to be fully defined.

Art Style: The GDD mentions "minimalist and clean," but doesn't give specific details. This needs to be visually defined, even if it's just with basic placeholder assets for the MVP.

Monetization: The GDD outlines both freemium and premium models. This should be decided early to determine in-game design elements. A freemium model would require a more robust structure to support purchases.

Room Structure: Linear or branched progression? This will influence level design.

Target Audience Refinement: While "casual" is mentioned, specifying age range and preferred puzzle types will help shape design choices.

Recommendation: Before moving to full production, address the unclear factors above. Create a prioritized list of features for the MVP, ensuring that the core gameplay loop is fully functional and enjoyable before expanding. Remember: An MVP is about validating the core concept, not creating the full game.





==============================================================================================================

Okay, let's break down the first task (creating the MVP for While Clear: Simplified) into technical documents. We'll assume a linear progression of rooms for simplicity in the MVP. The core puzzle mechanic will be simple code-breaking using a 4-digit keypad.

Here's a breakdown of the technical documents needed for the Phase 1 MVP:

Document 1: Technical Design Document - Room 1 (TDD-Room1.pdf)

1.1 Introduction: Briefly describes the purpose of this document (design specs for Room 1).
1.2 Room Overview:
Dimensions and layout of the room (simple square room is sufficient).
Description of visual elements (walls, floor, basic objects). References to placeholder assets or style guide.
Placement of interactive elements (keypad, clue objects).
1.3 Puzzle Design:
Detailed explanation of the code-breaking puzzle.
Number of digits in the code (4).
How clues are presented (e.g., numbers hidden in pictures, text clues).
Logic behind the clues (clearly defined steps to solve for the code).
Number of possible attempts (e.g., 3 incorrect attempts before game over).
1.4 User Interface (UI) Design:
Specification of UI elements (keypad buttons, input field, hint button [optional], game over screen).
Visual style for UI elements (simple, clear, and consistent).
Description of user interactions (clicking keypad buttons, entering code).
1.5 Game Logic:
Flowchart depicting the player interaction with the puzzle.
Conditions for winning (correct code entered).
Conditions for losing (incorrect code entered multiple times).
Pseudocode or basic code snippets for key functionality (code validation, clue activation).
1.6 Technical Specifications:
Engine used (Godot Engine recommended).
Programming language (GDScript for Godot).
Asset types used (simple 2D sprites).
Estimated development time for Room 1.
Document 2: User Interface (UI) Specification - Room 1 (UIS-Room1.pdf)

2.1 Introduction: Purpose of the document (UI specifications for Room 1).
2.2 Keypad Design: Detailed specifications for the keypad (size, button placement, visual style). Mockups or wireframes.
2.3 Input Field Design: Details on how the entered code is displayed (size, font, feedback).
2.4 Hint Button Design (Optional): Visual specifications and behavior (only if a hint system is included).
2.5 Game Over Screen Design: Visual design and messaging.
2.6 Color Palette and Font Selection: Specifies colors and fonts for consistency.
Document 3: Level Design Document - Room 1 (LDD-Room1.pdf)

3.1 Introduction: Focus of the document (level design for Room 1).
3.2 Room Layout: Detailed layout diagram showing the placement of objects and interactive elements.
3.3 Clue Placement: Precise location of each clue within the room and description of visual design.
3.4 Environmental Storytelling (Optional): Brief descriptions and references for any subtle story elements.
3.5 Playtesting Notes: Record of feedback from playtesting, including suggested changes.
Document 4: Asset List & Specifications (Assets.xlsx)

This would be a spreadsheet listing all assets needed for Room 1, their type (image, sound), and source (created, purchased, etc.).
These four documents cover the essential technical aspects of developing Room 1. Remember that this is for an MVP. Keep it simple, functional, and easily testable. These documents would be iterated upon as the project progresses to include further rooms.
